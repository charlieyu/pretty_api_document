###Installation
Put all files into a website and visit it.<br/>
In index.php, you will find a sample link to `http://[your host]/v1/index.php?file=Sample.xml`. <br/>
The page `http://[your host]/v1/index.php?file=Sample.xml` is created by the xml file located in `http://[your host]/v1/Sample.xml`. <br/>
Now you can modify the xml file and make a pretty document book for your own.<br/>
